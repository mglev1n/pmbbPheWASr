<!-- WARNING - This vignette is generated by {fusen} from dev/flat_pmbb_phewas.Rmd: do not edit by hand -->

<!-- Run this 'development' chunk -->
<!-- Store every call to library() that you need to explore your functions -->


<!--
 You need to run the 'description' chunk in the '0-dev_history.Rmd' file before continuing your code there.

If it is the first time you use {fusen}, after 'description', you can directly run the last chunk of the present file with inflate() inside.

<!-- 
 Store your dataset in a directory named "inst/" at the root of your project.
 Use it for your tests in this Rmd thanks to `pkgload::load_all()` to make it available
and `system.file()` to read it in your examples.

- There already is a dataset in the "inst/" directory to be used in the examples below

# Filter Variant Annotations File

The `pmbb_filter_exome_annotations` function filters the variant annotations file to only include variants within the specified gene. Because the variant annotation file is extremely large, this function wraps the `awk` shell command.
    

  

```{r example-pmbb_filter_exome_annotations_gene}
pmbb_filter_exome_annotations_gene(annotations_filename = "/project/PMBB/PMBB-Release-2020-2.0/Exome/Variant_annotations/PMBB-Release-2020-2.0_genetic_exome_variant-annotation-counts.txt",
                              gene_names = c("LDLR"))
```

# There can be development actions

Create a chunk with 'development' actions

- The chunk needs to be named `development` or `dev`
- It contains functions that are used for package development only
- Note that you may want to store most of these functions in the 0-dev_history.Rmd file

These are only included in the present flat template file, their content will not be part of the package anywhere else.
